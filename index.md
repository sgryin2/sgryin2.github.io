I am a masterâ€™s student in the Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of  Washington, USA. I am interested in the exciting field of VLSI.

I graduated from Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool in July, 2021. During my time there, I develop my academic foundation through courses such as Digital System Design, Electronic Circuits and Systems, and Integrated Circuits Concepts and Design. The skills that I gained from my undergraduate university translated to my master degree in University of Washington later. I joined University of Washington in 2021, I worked on various academic projects such as ASIC Implementation of Local Feature Detector in ORB SLAM3, JTAG Interface with Boundary Scan Register and so on. More details about my experiences in my [resume](/resume.pdf).
